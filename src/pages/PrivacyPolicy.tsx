              Automatically Collected Information Information about your
              computer hardware and software may be automatically collected by
              Zaymo. This information can include: your IP address, browser
              type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses.
              This information is used for the operation of the service, to
              maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics
              regarding use of the Zaymo website.

              Use of Cookies The Zaymo website may use "cookies" to help you
              personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that
              is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot
              be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.
              Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a
              web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience
              feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the
              Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example,
              if you personalize Zaymo pages, or register with Zaymo site or
              services, a cookie helps Zaymo to recall your specific information
              on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording
              your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping
              addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Zaymo website,
              the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you
              can easily use the Zaymo features that you customized.
            </p>
            <p>
              You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web
              browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify
              your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you
              choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience
              the interactive features of the Zaymo services or websites you
              visit.
